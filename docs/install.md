Installing Kharon
--------------------

Kharon is a software library, but it is intended to run in the cloud, so it is not installed locally.

Kharon is installed into and run on AWS lambda functions. The process of bundling the installed
Kharon library into lambda functions and deploying it is entirely automated by the scripts
in the `infra/` directory [(link to infra dir)](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/kharon/tree/master/infra).
